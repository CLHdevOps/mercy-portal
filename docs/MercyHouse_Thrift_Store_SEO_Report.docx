Competitive Advantage for Thrift Store 
Your unique positioning: 
Christian nonprofit thrift store + vehicle donation in Mississippi"
Most competitors are either: 
- National chains (Goodwill, Salvation Army) - less local focus 
- Secular organizations - missing Christian community 
- Vehicle-only or thrift-only - not integrated 
Your Content Should Emphasize: 
1. "Local Mississippi nonprofit serving your community" 
2. "Christian values-based organization" 
3. "100% of proceeds stay in Mississippi" 
4. "Vehicle AND item donations accepted" 
5. "Free pickup throughout MS"
